## Context

My wife and I travel a lot to attend BDSM-related parties. We like to play in front of an audience.

An upside to this is that we meet a lot of people, and many are not familiar with what we do.

Indeed, those events are sometimes hosted in non-bdsm locations (usually swingers clubs), and we sometimes meet people who are outside of the BDSM world.

Even for people part of BDSM world, which encompasses many things, our way of doing impact play sometimes raises interrogations.

I'll hence start my series with a longer-than-expected article summarizing what we do and why we do it.

I will not go into technical details or describe things in a precise manner, as this will be the object of the next chapters. 

## What we do.

My wife and I are into impact play, which is a subcategory of sadomasochism.

It can be roughly summarized as "using tools to inflict pain on targetted skin areas in order to provoke a variety of responses".

One of our particularities, which may be difficult to get until you watch us play, is that impact play is central in our practice, where for other people, it is secondary.

To explain this well, let's first assume that the objective of engaging in sex or kink is to experience pleasure from it. People are usualy looking for a set of precise things to experience pleasure. For example, a submissive may experience pleasure in the feelings of submission, humiliation, ownership, or degradation. Those will be their primary source of pleasure.

Those primary sources of pleasure can be enhanced by secondary source of pleasures. To continue with our example, for our submissive, getting whipped, slapped or spanked can be used as a way to increase the feeling of humiliation. This person is not necessarily looking to receive those treatments per-se, but getting those treatments by their dominant will enhance what they are looking for and will give them pleasure. The spankings, slaps and whip impact may or may not be aggreable themselves, as it is, in this context, irrelevant.

My wife and I play in a way where impact play is central, in the sense that it is the pain itself that is the pleasing element. We do incorporate some other elements as well (some light bondage and some submission markers which we enjoy) but those are secondary. The main pleasure that we derive comes from impact play itself.

Now, do not read this the wrong way. This paragraph does not aim at establishing some form of hierarchy of purity of play, nor to do some kind of preaching around the supposed centrality of impact play.

Rather, it aims at giving a frame of reference so that you can evaluate how relevant the content of this website is in your own situation.

This series of articles will not contain advices on how to incorporate impact play into existing practices, in order for you to experience more pleasure.

Conversely, my approach in this series will be to place impact play at the center, and eventually provide advices on how to incorporate secondary elements into it to make it more enjoyable. 

Now, let's cover why the hell someone with all their sanity would engage in sadomasochism.

## Why we do it.

For us, impact play is ultimately a form of metabolical hacking, that allows my wife to enter a state of trance, and at the peak of it, to experience a form of extasy at every hit. 
From an outsider's perspective, she may look like she's experiencing a high, and we'll soon see that in fact, she is actually experiencing one, from a metabolical standpoint.

This trance that she experiences, and the feelings associated with it are the major reason why we are doing what we do. It is not for sex (I have observed that the sex drive decreases as the trance intensifies), it is not for submission, it is for the trance.

Here is what our sessions look like : we start by a very slow warmup where I spank her either my hands and a light leather paddle. At the end of it, she is very relaxed, and the impacts are still painful if I go harder. Then we do a first real session with actual floggers where I gradually increase the intensity. At the end of it she is usually in the state that I mentioned earlier, and with every impact she feels a high degree of pleasure, alongside the pain accompanying the hit.

## Some theoretical background.

Now if you've read until here, you should start to wonder if there is something wrong in my wife's mind.

How could someone in their right mind experience actual pleasure from receiving pain, that sounds about antithetic, right ?

Even if that is a completely normal thing to ask, I can assure you that my wife is perfectly fine, and that you could probably experience the same thing, if you were willing to give it a try.

Indeed, there is some practical evidence that impact play is actually a simple form of metabolical hacking which acts on the nervous system's pain/pleasure processing, and that the high that the receiver experiences is just the body's natural reaction to the impacts. Let's elaborate on how it works.

The rest of this chapter will summarize elements that can be found in the following paper : [Physical Pain as Pleasure: A Theoretical Perspective](/files/physical_pain_as_pleasure.pdf)

This paper gives a theoretical skeleton to what impact play practitioners just "feel". I encourage the reader to take a look as it will give much more details than my short summary below.
