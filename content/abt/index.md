Hi, I'm Adam, husband and dom.

A few considerations before anything else.

{{< alert >}}
My wife and I are strictly monogamous, and are not looking for sexual partners, but we do like to socialize.

We are not professionals, do not offer any form of paid services, and never will.

This website is not a proxy for paid content.

The projects that I eventually describe in this website are not for sale but feel free to replicate them.

If you reach out on Fet or via mail, I may take some time to respond but I promise I will.

{{< /alert >}}

Now that this is said, let's begin. 

I have created this website for two purposes.

## Introducing impact play

Me and my dear wife are both into impact play and we are travelling around as often as we can to attend BDSM parties.

We sometimes meet people who are a bit surprised by the fact that someone would find an interest in getting their butt spanked for around two and a half hours in front of total strangers.

I often try to mention the endorphin release mechanisms of the body, the pleasure that one derives from it and how we try to take control of it, but I often find it difficult to convey all of that in an articulated way in less than one minute, with people that I just met.
Also, people seem surprised when they hear someone that they just saw swinginging a flogger for 30 minutes suddenly start talking about metabolism in a very serious manner.

My hope is that this website could help folks to get a decent understanding of what impact play is.

## Impact play knowledge base.

Sometimes, curious people ask us how to get started, and since it is easy to get it wrong the first time, I am hesitant to give them directions in the short time that we can share.

When I started impact play I read some books about flogging and related topics, but I was always frustrated by the lack of actual technical information. There does not seem to be many places where one can find detailed scene breakdowns, and explanations about them.

One of my goals with this website is to provide technically-focused information on impact play so that newcomers can get started efficiently and avoid making the same mistakes I made.

## Writing about my projects.

I like to make things, and some of my projects don't really belong to a regular blog.

Needless to explain why I can't really publish a "how to make an impact play rolling bag from scratch" on instructables.

Those projects are not for sale, but I generally try to give as much details as possible so that other hobbyists can replicate them semi-easily.

## How to reach out.

If you have questions about the projects that I describe, or about impact play in general, please don’t hesitate to friend+DM me on Fet at adam-delacroix, or to send me a mail at the address linked in the home page, but please keep the disclaimers listed at the top of this page in mind.

I hope that you will find my website useful.
